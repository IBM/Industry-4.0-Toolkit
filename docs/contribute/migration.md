# Site Migration

This page is a place holder to send users when a link is removed, either because the content was retired or the content got move to other page(s).

To help the migration we need it to create redirects for some use cases:
- For pages that remain then a redirect to the new location url
- For pages that got removed a redirect to a page explaining what happened with the content. It could be the content got spread into other pages or the page was not relevant anymore.
